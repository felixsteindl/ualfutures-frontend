In collaboration with Conway Hall, it&#8217;s a comedy and science variety night with more </span><span class=\"s1\">unnecessary detail than ever before. To make room for all the extra unnecessary detail, several required details have had to go. So come along and see the show at a place and on a date in November, starting at a time and finishing at a different time.</span></p>\n",
